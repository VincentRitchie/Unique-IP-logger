 The Unique IP Address Logger is a Python script that logs IP addresses while ensuring each IP is unique. The program features an interactive input method and displays a custom ASCII art banner to indicate my ownership. Perfect for network traffic monitoring and tracking unique visitors.
Unique IP Logger
Overview
The Unique IP Logger is a simple Python script designed to log unique IP addresses entered by the user. It ensures that each IP address is recorded only once and provides a clear and organized way to keep track of unique IPs.

Features
1. Banner Display: Print a banner to introduce the program and the author (Vincent Chimaobi).
2. Unique IP Logging: Logs each unique IP address entered by the user.
3. Exit Option: Allows the user to exit the program by typing 'done'.

How It Works
1. Print Banner: The script starts by displaying a banner with the author's name.
2. Input Loop: The user is prompted to enter IP addresses. The loop continues until 'done' is entered.
3. Unique IP Storage: IP addresses are stored in a set to ensure uniqueness.
3. Exit and Display: When 'done' is entered, the loop ends, and the logged unique IPs are displayed.

Future Enhancements
1. File Logging: Implement functionality to write logged IPs to a file for persistence.
2. Validation: Add IP address validation to ensure only valid IPs are logged.
3. User Interface: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
4. Logging Metadata: Enhance the logging functionality to include metadata like timestamps and user information.
5. Integration: Integrate with other cybersecurity tools to automate IP logging in real-time during penetration testing.
6. Alert System: Implement an alert system to notify users of duplicate IPs or suspicious activities.
7. Database Integration: Store IPs in a database for scalable and efficient management.
8. Reporting: Generate reports on logged IPs, including statistics and analysis.
